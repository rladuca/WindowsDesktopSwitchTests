# Windows Desktop Switch Tests
These tests exercise various switch combinations in the build of a WindowsDesktop project to ensure that they have appropriate outcomes with respect to the build and build output.
## Instructions
From a powershell window, run ".\RunTests.ps1".  This will run the tests in turn.

Once these are done, look for any red colored output.  This indicates a failure.  Failures can be analyzed by looking at the various binlogs saved in the logs directory or saving the logs directory and sharing it with the appropriate team.
